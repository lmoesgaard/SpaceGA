    "Notebook for setting up and runnning a SpaceGA. The scoring function selected below is LogPSearch (trying to find moleceules with a high logP), but it can be switched for LogPSearch or DockSearch if desired. Just remember to switch the scoring inputs as well. To run SpaceGA, you need to have [SpaceLight](https://www.biosolveit.de/spacelight-a-spotlight-on-the-analog-hunter-for-chemical-spaces/) installed with a license. Further, to use [Lilly Medchem Rules](https://github.com/IanAWatson/Lilly-Medchem-Rules) as an additional filter, you need to have that installed as well. "
