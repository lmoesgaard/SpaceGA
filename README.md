# SpaceGA
Tools for accelerated searching of chemical spaces using molecular docking. [SpaceGA](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c01308) is a new screening method that utilizes the similarity search tool [SpaceLight](https://www.biosolveit.de/spacelight-a-spotlight-on-the-analog-hunter-for-chemical-spaces/) by BiosolveIT and a [graph-based genetic algorithm (GB-GA)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C8SC05372C) to navigate large combinatorial spaces. In short, SpaceGA explores the desired chemical space using the same crossover module as the GB-GA by Jensen but replaces the mutation module with a similarity search using SpaceGA to identify "available mutations". In this way, SpaceGA is restricted to the suggested molecules in the supplemented space only.\
Code for reproducing the results from the [SpaceGA](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c01308) can be found in the dedicated directory (./SpaceGApaper). If you are just interested in the most recent version of SpaceGA, then go to the SpaceGA directory.
